# Data Engineering with Azure, Dataricks and PySpark
Data engineering project with Azure and Databricks. This project is underway and is updated as it is worked on. There are parts that are not included becasue they are completed with the Azure UI and not IAC. The data is using the Ergast API for formula 1 racing results since the 1950's to current.
Read me will be updated with visulas and examples later on as the project reaches its final stages,
